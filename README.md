A selection of files for processing and analyzing single cell RNA sequencing experiments in primarily python (scanPy). Single_Vac is for single experiments, Integration is for the merging and integration of those samples, dataplayer contains useful short scripts after the resulting h5ad files have been created. These files take in the filtered_feature_matrix output from cellranger. The environment file requires the ability to build annoy, so if you are struggling with install due to an annoy failure, then ensure that your C/C++ compilers are up to date (Windows dev tools, GCC, etc.)
